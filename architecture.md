# Original Enterprise AI - Technical Architecture

## Overview
Original Enterprise AI is a hierarchical AI platform with three distinct layers that work in concert to deliver strategic intelligence across enterprise organizations.

## Core Architectural Principles
- **Hierarchical Intelligence**: LOCAL (edge) → Enterprise (operational) → Group (strategic)
- **One-Way Data Flow**: Lower layers cannot access higher layers (security & control)
- **Functional Superset**: Each higher layer contains all capabilities of lower layers plus additional strategic functions
- **Explainable AI**: All recommendations include transparent rationale

## Layer 1: LOCAL Nodes (Edge Intelligence)
**Purpose**: Real-time data collection and local decision-making at physical sites
- **Deployment**: Factories, warehouses, retail locations
- **Key Systems**: MES, SCADA, IoT sensors, quality control systems
- **AI Capabilities**: Local anomaly detection, real-time optimization
- **Resilience**: Offline operation capability with secure data sync

## Layer 2: Enterprise Manager (Operational Intelligence)
**Purpose**: Unified operational intelligence for a single business unit
- **Integration**: Connects all LOCAL Nodes + Head Office systems (ERP, CRM, HRMS)
- **AI Capabilities**: Predictive analytics, scenario simulation, optimization
- **User Interface**: Natural language queries, role-based dashboards
- **External Context**: Market trends, weather, regulatory data

## Layer 3: Group Manager (Strategic Intelligence)
**Purpose**: Cross-entity strategic oversight for multi-organization enterprises
- **Orchestration**: Coordinates multiple Enterprise Managers
- **Strategic Functions**: M&A modeling, capital planning, ESG integration
- **World Context**: Global market intelligence, geopolitical analysis
- **User Level**: CXO and board-level decision support

## Technical Stack
- **AI/ML**: NLP with RAG, LSTM/transformers, multi-agent optimization
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud-native (AWS/Azure/GCP) with edge computing
- **Security**: TLS 1.3, read-only APIs, comprehensive audit logging
- **Compliance**: GDPR, HIPAA, ISO27001, SOC2 aligned
